# frozen_string_literal: true

# Hierarchical comments on a post, modelled the DynamoDB way: one table, keyed by
# (post_id, path).
#
#   * partition key `post_id` — every comment on a post is colocated, so the whole
#     thread is a single Query.
#   * sort key `path` — a *materialized path*: the chain of time-ordered segment
#     ids from the post down to this comment, joined by "/".
#
# Because DynamoDB returns a Query sorted by the sort key, ordering by `path`
# yields the thread in pre-order (a parent immediately precedes its subtree, and
# siblings are chronological). Depth is just the number of "/" separators — so
# nesting renders straight from one query, no recursion at read time.
#
#   reply to the post   -> path = "<seg>"                    (depth 0)
#   reply to a comment  -> path = "<parent.path>/<seg>"      (depth 1, 2, …)
